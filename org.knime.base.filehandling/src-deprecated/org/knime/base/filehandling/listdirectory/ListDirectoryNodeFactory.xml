	<name>List Remote Files (legacy)</name>

	<shortDescription>
		List the files contained in a directory.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node creates a list with the URIs of the files that are
			contained in the specified directory (the content of sub folders can
			be listed as well). It is also shown if the corresponding URI
			represents a directory or not.
			There are 3 filters available: file
			extension(s), wildcard
			pattern or
			regular expression.
			<br />
			The location of the directory can either be local (if no
			connection
			information is given) or on a remote
			server.
            <p>
                <i>This legacy file handling node has been replaced by the

                and will become deprecated in the foreseeable future. For further information about the 
                new file handling framework see the
