		List the files contained in a directory.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node creates a list with the URIs of the files that are
			contained in the specified directory (the content of sub folders can
			be listed as well). It is also shown if the corresponding URI
			represents a directory or not.
			There are 3 filters available: file
			extension(s), wildcard
			pattern or
			regular expression.
			<br />
			The location of the directory can either be local (if no
			connection
			information is given) or on a remote
			server.
		</intro>


		<option name="Directory">
			Select the folders to be scanned. Also KNIME-URLs
			like "knime://knime.workflow/"
			are accepted.
		</option>
		<option name="Include sub folders">
			If enabled the content of the
			sub folders will be
			included as well. If disabled sub folders will be
			ignored.
		</option>
		<option name="Filter:">
			Specifies the filter to be applied:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li> none: all files will be included</li>
				<li> regular expression: only the files matching the regular
					expression will be included.
				</li>
				<li> wildcard pattern: only the files matching the wildcard pattern
					will be included.
				</li>
				<li> extension(s): only the files with the right extension will be
					included.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
		<option name="Extensions / expression:">Define the file extension(s),
			a wildcard pattern or
			a regular expression for the filter. For
			multiple extensions ";" acts
			as the separator. This option is
			ignored if no filter is selected.
