    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Converts the url strings of the specified string column into file
			path strings. Four columns will be appended on the input data 
			table. One, containing the complete file paths, one containing the 
			parent folder of the files, one containing the file names (without 
			extensions), and one containing the file extensions.
			<br/>
			It can be specified whether the node will fail if an invalid url 
			string occurs or a file location does not exist. If failing is 
			switched off (default) missing values will be inserted as file
			paths, parent folders, file names, as well as file extensions.
