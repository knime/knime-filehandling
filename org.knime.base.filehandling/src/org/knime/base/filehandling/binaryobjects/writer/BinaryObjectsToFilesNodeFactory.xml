	<name>Binary Objects to Files</name>
	<shortDescription>
		 Write the binary objects of a table as files.
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node writes binary objects to files. It will append the paths of binary files to the 
			input table as well as the corresponding write status (created, unmodified, overwritten).
		</intro>
		<option name="Binary object">
			Options for selecting a column with binary data from input table. And whether the original binary column 
			should be included in the output.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Column: </b>
					Column containing the binary objects to write.
					<br />
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Remove column: </b>
					If checked the column containing the binary objects is removed from the output table.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
        <option name="File names">
        	Select an option for the binary file names, by default files will be  generated using "File_?.dat" pattern. 
        	There are two options to choose from. 
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Generate: </b>
					The names will be generated using the provided pattern. The pattern must contain a single "?" 
					symbol. This symbol will, during execution, be replaced by an incrementing counter to make the
					filenames unique.
					<br />
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>From column: </b>
					Allows to select a column containing the filenames under which the corresponding binary object
					has to be stored. 
				</li>
			</ul>
        </option>
		<option name="Write to">
			Select a file system which stores the files you want to generate.
			There are three default file system options to choose from:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>Local File System:</i>
					Allows you to select a file/folder from your
					local system.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Mountpoint:</i>
					Allows you to read from a mountpoint.When selected, a new drop-down
					menu appears to choose the mountpoint. Unconnected mountpoints are
					greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is
					disabled in this case). Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the
					mountpoint to enable browsing. A mountpoint is displayed in red if
					it was previously selected but is no longer available. You won't be
					able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e.
					known mountpoint.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Relative to:</i>
					Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
					relative to the
					current mountpoint, current workflow or the current
					workflow's data
					area.
					When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of
					the three
					options to use.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
		<option name="Folder">
			The directory where the files will be put.
		</option>
		<option name="Create missing folders">
			Select if the folders of the selected output location should be created if they do not already exist.
			If this option is unchecked, the node will fail if a folder does not exist.
		</option>
		<option name="If exists">
			Specifies the behavior if one of the files already exists.
			<br />
			<b>Overwrite</b>
			<br />
			Overwrite the existing file.
			<br />
			<b>Ignore</b>
			<br />
			Will ignore if a file already exists and skip the writing process for this particular binary object / file.
			<br />
			<b>Fail</b>
			<br />
			Will issue an error during the node's execution (to prevent unintentional overwrite).
		</option>

            Table that contains the binary objects that will be written to files.

        <outPort name="Output table" index="0">
            The input table containing two additional columns. The one containing the path to the just written binary 
            files and the other encodes the corresponding write status (created, unmodified, overwritten). If <i>remove 
            column</i> has been checked the selected <i>binary object column</i> is removed from the output.
