        <intro>
        	This node monitors a directory for file changes (creation, deletion, and modification) and executes a loop iteration
        	once such changes are detected. The output table of the node contains the event type, the absolute file path, and the path
        	relative to the monitored directory.
        </intro>
		<option name="Local Path">The path to the local directory which should be monitored for changes.</option>
		<option name="End Criterion">
			Determines when to stop the loop execution.
			<ul>
				<li><b>Duration:</b>Stop after the specified time interval.
					If this option is selected, the node may output an empty table after the time is up.</li>
				<li><b>Number of Events:</b>Stop after the specified number of events have been detected.</li>
				<li><b>Number of Loops:</b>Stop after the specified number of iterations. One iteration can have multiple events.</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
		<option name="Events">The event types to monitor.</option>
		<option name="Extensions / expression:">Define the file extension(s),
			a wildcard pattern or a regular expression for the filter. For
			multiple extensions ";" acts as the separator. This option is 
			ignored	if no filter is selected.
        </option>

		<option name="case sensitive:">If checked the filter is case sensitive.</option>
