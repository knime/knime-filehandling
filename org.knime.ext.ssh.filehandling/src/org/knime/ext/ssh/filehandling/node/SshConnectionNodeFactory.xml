    <name>SSH Connector (Labs)</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Connects to remote file system by SSH in order to read/write files in downstream nodes.

    <fullDescription>
         <intro>
            <p>This node connects to remote file system by SSH. The resulting output port allows downstream nodes to access
            the <i>files</i> of the remote file system, e.g. to read or write,
            or to perform other file system operations (browse/list files, copy, move, ...).
            </p>
            
            <p><b>Path syntax:</b> Paths for SSH are specified with a UNIX-like syntax, /myfolder/myfile. An absolute
            for SSH consists of:
                <ol>
                    <li>A leading slash ("/").</li>
                    <li>Followed by the path to the file ("myfolder/myfile" in the above example).</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

		        paths, i.e. paths that do not have a leading slash. The default working directory is the root "/", under which all the
		        document libraries are located.
